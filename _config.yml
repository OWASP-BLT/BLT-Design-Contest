# GitHub Pages configuration
# The site is built by the GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/build.yml.
# The script generates index.html (main landing page) plus one HTML page per contest
# (e.g. blt-tshirt.html, blt-logo.html, blt-homepage.html), commits them back to the
# main branch, and deploys the whole set to GitHub Pages via the deploy-pages action.
